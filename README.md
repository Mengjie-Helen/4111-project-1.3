**Project summary**:

We are proposing an entity-relationship model for the Petco chain store management system. 
Petco chain store is an industry-leading health and wellness company focused on improving the lives of pets. 
Petco operates more than 20 Petco stores in New York City which offer a wide range of petsâ€™ products.
This ER-model contains basically the whole procedure of how the Petco stores run. 
We take entities such as customer, payment, insurance, pet, product, employee, manager, shop, and supplier.

+ The URL of the web application is: (https://)

**Implementation of the proposal**: 

Customer is able to:

+ Query shift information
+ Query shop directory
+ Record payment information

Manager is able to:
+ View employee information
+ View payment information
+ Query shop directory
+ Edit supply list
+ View supplier list

Supplier is able to:
+ View shop product list

As for the Admin part mentioned in Part 1 proposal, we moved the Record payment information to Employee, the Query shop directory to Employee and Manager, the Edit supply list to Manager.

+ Type in
